## üß™ Research Background

Soil microbial communities play a pivotal role in determining plant productivity, resilience, and nutrient uptake. While genome sequencing has advanced our understanding of individual microorganisms, **metagenomics** enables the holistic study of complex microbial communities in natural environments‚Äîsuch as the rhizosphere of palm kernel plants.

In tropical agriculture, especially in palm oil production systems, **mineral composition** of the soil affects the diversity and metabolic activities of associated microbes. Understanding these **mineral-microbe interactions** through a metagenomics lens offers novel opportunities for **sustainable agricultural innovations**.

This research integrates **AI**, **bioinformatics**, and **systems biology** to model and predict the functional role of microbiomes in palm oil-producing ecosystems, thereby informing **smart farming** decisions.
