# Harnessing Metagenomic and Mineral-Microbe Interactions for Next-Gen Agricultural Innovations in Palm Oil Systems 🌱🧬

This repository hosts the in-silico research project exploring the intersection of **metagenomics**, **mineral-microbe interactions**, and **AI-powered agricultural innovation** with a focus on **palm oil systems**.

## 🔬 Project Focus
We investigate how soil minerals influence plant-associated microbial communities in palm oil-producing environments using **metagenomics** and **artificial intelligence**. The goal is to uncover microbial functions that contribute to sustainable and resilient palm kernel cultivation.
