**In-silico Exploration of Bioremediation via Mineralâ€“Microbe Interactions**

This project presents a bioinformatics-based (in-silico) investigation into the molecular mechanisms and pathways through which microbes degrade petroleum pollutants, particularly in association with naturally occurring minerals. Using gene mining, metabolic pathway reconstruction, and microbial-metagenomic annotation, we aim to model how indigenous bacteria catalyze hydrocarbon breakdown.

ðŸ§¬ **Main Goals:**

Curate and analyze known hydrocarbon biodegradation genes (e.g., alkB, camAâ€“D, almA, xylE).

Reconstruct metabolic pathways using databases like KEGG and MetaCyc.

Simulate microbial activity in the presence of mineral co-factors (e.g., Fe(III), clay minerals).

Explore soil metagenomic datasets from petroleum-contaminated environments.

ðŸ”§ **Tools & Technologies:**

Biopython, Bash

QIIME2, BLAST, HMMER

KEGG, MetaCyc, UniProt

Python (pandas, matplotlib), R (DESeq2)
