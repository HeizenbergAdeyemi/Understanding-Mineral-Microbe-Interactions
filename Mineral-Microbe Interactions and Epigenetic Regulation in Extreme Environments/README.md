# Mineral-Microbe Interactions and Epigenetic Regulation in Extreme Environments

This repository hosts a bioinformatics-driven research project exploring how mineral-associated microbial communities influence epigenetic regulation in *Austrofundulus limnaeus* (annual killifish) embryos during anoxia. By integrating transcriptomic, epigenomic, and metagenomic data, the study investigates molecular mechanisms that support stress resilience and developmental regulation in extreme environments.

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Analyze microbial communities associated with mineral-rich, low-oxygen environments.
- Investigate epigenetic modifications in *A. limnaeus* during anoxia and dormancy.
- Integrate microbial and host molecular data to identify possible microbe-host regulatory links.

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies
- Data: RNA-Seq, CUT&RUN/ChIP-Seq, 16S rRNA metagenomics
- Tools: FastQC, Trimmomatic, DESeq2, QIIME2, Bismark, Bowtie2, NetworkX, Cytoscape
- Languages: Python, R, Bash
