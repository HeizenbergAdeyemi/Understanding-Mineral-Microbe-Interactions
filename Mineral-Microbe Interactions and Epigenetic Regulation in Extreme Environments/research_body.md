# Mineral-Microbe Interactions and Epigenetic Regulation in Extreme Environments

## ðŸ§  Research Background
Organisms in mineral-rich, anoxic environments often rely on tight physiological and molecular regulation for survival. *Austrofundulus limnaeus*, a unique model for anoxia tolerance and developmental dormancy, provides an ideal system to explore how mineral-associated microbial communities influence host epigenetic mechanisms.

This study investigates how such microbial communitiesâ€”found in sedimentary and mineral-abundant environmentsâ€”interact with host embryos at the molecular level, particularly through changes in histone modifications, DNA methylation, and gene expression.

## ðŸ“¥ Data Sourcing

| Data Type | Source | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| RNA-Seq | NCBI SRA / GEO | Gene expression during anoxia in *A. limnaeus* |
| CUT&RUN / ChIP-Seq | GEO / ENA | To detect histone PTMs and epigenetic regulators |
| Metagenomics (16S rRNA) | MG-RAST / EBI | Microbial communities from mineral-rich, anoxic environments |
| Environmental metadata | Public literature | Oxygen levels, mineral concentrations, incubation conditions |

## ðŸ§ª Research Design & Methodology

### Objective
To uncover the role of mineral-associated microbial communities in shaping the epigenetic response of *A. limnaeus* embryos under anoxic stress.

### Key Hypothesis
Mineral-rich microbial environments influence the host epigenome, modulating stress tolerance and developmental regulation in *A. limnaeus*.

### Workflow

#### 1. Microbial Analysis
- Process 16S rRNA data using QIIME2
- Identify taxa commonly associated with minerals (e.g., Fe-, Mn-, S-reducing bacteria)
- Infer microbial metabolites with potential epigenetic activity (e.g., butyrate, folate)

#### 2. Transcriptomics
- Download RNA-Seq data from anoxic and normoxic embryos
- Perform quality control (FastQC, Trimmomatic)
- Conduct differential expression analysis using DESeq2

#### 3. Epigenetic Profiling
- Analyze ChIP-Seq or CUT&RUN data for key histone modifications (e.g., H3K27me3, H3K9ac)
- Perform methylation profiling with Bismark if available
- Correlate epigenetic changes with gene expression patterns

#### 4. Integration
- Link microbial presence and predicted metabolites to shifts in gene regulation
- Build microbe-gene interaction networks using Cytoscape and NetworkX
- Explore predictive patterns between microbial influence and epigenetic markers

### Expected Outcomes
- Identification of key mineral-associated microbial taxa that correlate with host epigenetic shifts
- Maps of histone modifications or methylation linked to stress-tolerant developmental pathways
- A conceptual model of mineral-microbe-host crosstalk in extreme, anoxic environments
